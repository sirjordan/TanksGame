TanksGame
=========

Tanks

Like the classical Battle City game, this is the console implementation of it. 
You move a tank with the keyboard arrows, and shoot with the spacebar.
You can destroy bricks and enemyTanks.
There's enemy tanks of course, that move in the pseudo inteligent directions.
There's also a .txt file to hold the best players.

More specific:
In this project is used basic, and maybe more complicated object oriented programing technique.
The program logic i separated in the .cs files, every file is different class.
To run the project it has to be created visual studio or other .NET 4 platform and compilator.
